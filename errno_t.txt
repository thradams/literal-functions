Title:  Remove errno_t dependency from Annex K


ABSTRACT

I propose to define errno_t independently of __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ .

Rationale:

   We have the following note in the standard:

   "458) As a matter of programming style, errno_t can be used as the type of something 
   that deals only with the values that can be found in errno. For example, a function 
   which returns the value of errno could be declared as having the return type
   errno_t.
   "

   Since errno is independt of annex K, errno also whould be.

Breaking changes

In case some code is defining errno_t with a differently from 
typedef int errno_t , and including <errno.h> for instance,
the it is a breaking change. But this is improvale, the already 
existence of errno_t inside the standard (even if optional).
